Embark on a choose-your-own journey to uncover local hidden gems and hotspots tailored specifically to you. Check in at landmarks, complete location-based challenges, and earn points as you discover the best of your community, even if you're only adopting it for a visit.

### Business / Government Benefits

CivicQuest was designed with the cooperation of businesses and government in mind. The system includes integration APIs for Local Government and business events, user requestable information updates, integration into popular booking and ordering systems, and tie into existing city apps.

Incentive and rewards can be managed by businesses, along with ads and promotions. 

Cities love CivicQuest, with our itineraries and quests encouraging an estimated 41% increase in tourism expenditure and 64% increase in local spending. Excellent for the local economy, and users report an improved desire to return to active CivicQuest cities.

### How is CivicQuest Different?

CivicQuest isn't just another travel app - it's an AI-powered urban adventure game that makes exploring your city fun and rewarding.

While traditional itinerary builders simply suggest lists of places to go, CivicQuest takes you on an interactive quest around your city tailored to your personal interests. Our AI chatbot gets to know your preferences and curates a gamified sightseeing experience with challenges to complete at local landmarks.

Checking in and discovering new locations earns you points to climb leaderboards and unlock discounts from partner businesses. It's like real-life Pokemon Go meets a travel concierge, making tourism feel more like an RPG.

The social features let you collaborate and compete with other users on quests. So you can finally settle the debate over who really knows your city the best, and who has the best hidden gem locations.

Unlike apps locked into certain cities, our ever-expanding database covers exciting destinations globally. We integrate with other urban apps and services like Google Maps too, bringing everything together in one place.

The AI assistant refines recommendations based on your ratings and activity, continuously learning your preferences. You can easily swap out suggested events with a Tinder-like swipe interface until your perfect itinerary emerges.

With CivicQuest, every day in the city feels like a vacation. We encourage you to explore (or re-explore) forgotten gems and local businesses while discovering new hotspots.

Whether you're a tourist or resident, our AI-powered quests transform urban exploration into an exciting game where rewards await around every corner. The adventure starts now!
